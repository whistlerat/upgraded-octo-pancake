** Don't forget to run the .venv so you have OpenCV and imutils (pyimage's library)
CTRL + SHIFT + P -> "Python: Select Interpreter" -> select the .venv to run imutils
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments

Create an environment in windows:
python -m venv .venv

python -m (command) basically dictates which python to use to run that command
- in this case, it's venv

#NOTE TO SELF:
figure out how to just write a bash file to do the venv setup...

###GOAL: Find the activate script
VSCODE: source .venv/Scripts/activate
